										<h2>Saumya Verma</h2>
										<h3>Co-Founder</h3>
										<p>I am a rising junior attending Lynbrook High School, and I love to code in Java, Python, and other programming languages. I am very passionate about computer science, and I take a lot of interest in subjects related to artificial inteligence and machine learning. In addition, I am very passionate about teaching and sharing my knowledge with other students. Since an early age, I have always enjoyed teaching my little sister new subjects that I had learned. In my freshman year, I was able to take my passion to the next level by instructing elementary school students different topics related to science and technology. During this pandemic, I would like to continue to helping others by enabling more students to have the opportunity to explore the field of computer science. Through ChiCode, I hope to be able to reach out to more people across the world and present them with our online courses. I am thrilled to be one of the co-founders at ChiCode, and I am looking forward to making an impact through my contribution.

										<h2>Nishi Kaura</h2>
										<h3>Co-Founder</h3>
										<p>My vision in cofounding ChiCode is to allow children and young adults to gain access to computer literacy. This idea was first born when I visited an orphanage in developing country while in elementary school and noticed that many children don’t have access to basic computer literacy. Later in middle school, I revisited the orphanage after hosting a fundraiser to donate laptops and taught the children basic computer literacy. During my freshman year, I founded A-Z Hacks, a non profit organization and hosted a 100 hacker plus hackathon in partnership with Women in Tech at LinkedIn in an effort to promote girls interest in technology. During COVID 19 pandemic, I want to continue my efforts to help children and young adults to learn/improve their computer skills safely by providing them access to online computer courses. Creating online courses is my humble effort to use my passion for Computer Science to make computer literacy accessible to aspiring students.

										<h2>Rahul Kaura</h2>
										<h3>Co-Founder</h3>
										<p>Since an early age, I have been passionate about technology and it’s role to solve real life problems. It’s been my mission to provide a platform for other students like me to come up with new technology ideas to help the community in general. To accomplish this, I founded a student-led non-profit organization, A-Z Hacks. A-Z Hacks provided platform for 100+ students to encourage coders of all skill levels to innovate and build projects that can revolutionize and improve lives. For this, I partnered with Fortune 500 company LinkedIn among others such as NOVA, Magoosh, and students from Bay area schools. Additionally, I am an intern at Stria Blind, sponsored by Fortune 500 company Google, a company which is dedicated to helping the blind community find their way in the world by creating an innovative walking stick. While founding Chicode, my intent is to leverage my leadership skills and experience to provide free online technical courses to local and international students especially during the COVID 19 Pandemic. I am excited to serve as co-founder of ChiCode.
